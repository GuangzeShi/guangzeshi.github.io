# **About Me**

Yidi Li is currently an associate professor in the College of Computer Science and Technology at Taiyuan University of Technology (太原理工大学, 计算机科学与技术学院). Prior to that, she received the PhD degree in Computer Science and Technology from Peking University under the supervision of ***[Prof. Hong Liu](https://robotics.pkusz.edu.cn)*** in 2023. She has published more than 10 papers in top international conferences and SCI journals in the field of artificial intelligence. She serves as a reviewer for many important journals and conferences in the field of artificial intelligence, such as CAAI TRIT, AAAI, and ICASSP. She serves as an expert judge for 3D Digital Innovation Design Competition, and other national events.

 

Yidi Li's research work centers on audio-visual fusion, and is dedicated to improving the model's adaptability and robustness in complex dynamic scenarios by investigating multimodal heterogeneous data fusion problems, and multimodal multilevel information interaction problems. Her research interests include audio-visual learning, sound source localization, speech recognition, and speaker tracking.
